# Julia Vs. Python Numba

Curious about how Julia compares with Python Numba in terms of performance.

- [Naive String Concatenation](https://github.com/tk3369/JuliaVsPythonNumba/blob/master/Comparison%20Programming%20Languages%20Test.md) - how Numba makes things worse for non-numerical functions
- [Comparision of Programming Languages for Economics](https://github.com/tk3369/JuliaVsPythonNumba/blob/master/Comparison%20Programming%20Languages%20Test.md) - benchmarking for a numerical algorithm written by an economist
- [Black Scholes](https://github.com/tk3369/JuliaVsPythonNumba/blob/master/BlackScholes.md) - black scholes option pricing from [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-examples/examples/finance/blackscholes/results.html)
